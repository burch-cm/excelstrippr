The goal of excelstrippr is to provide an easy way to remove the extraneous
metadata, headers, summaries, etc., and extract the useful tabular data from Excel-based reports. 

## The Problem  
Excel reports often contain titles, data summaries, line counts, empty columns, 
etc., which make importing them into R a troublesome process. 
As there is no universal Excel report format, 
it's difficult to write a reusable script to munge and import the data from 
these reports.

An example Excel report might look like this:  
![Example Excel Report](./man/img/init-excel.png)  

Unhiding hidden elements and adjusting empty columns to make them more clear shows 
that this report isn't in any kind of standard tabular format:  
![Example Excel Report - Unhidden](./man/img/unhidden-excel.png)

When this data is imported into R, the results are not useful without serious 
wrangling:  
```{r init-excel}
dat <- readxl::read_excel("./man/example/example-report.xlsx")
head(dat, 10)
```

## The Solution  
excelstrippr will look for the start of a tabular data set in an Excel file, ignoring 
titles, summaries, and other meta-data in the report. 

```{r strip-example}
library(excelstrippr)
dat_stripped <- strip_metadata("./man/example/example-report.xlsx")
head(dat_stripped, 10)
```

The extracted data can then be saved back into another file for future analysis or can be immediately used in analysis pipeline as any other data frame object.
